            <h1>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman</h1>
            <p>C. V. Raman was one of the most influential and great scientists and physicists in India. He enlightened
                the world about the nature of light through his extensive research and discoveries throughout his life.
                He discovered the “Raman Effect” which fetched him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. The Government of
                India has declared 28th February as the National Science day to honor the contribution of C V Raman and
                his discovery of the <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering" target="_blank">“Raman
                    Effect”</a>.
